# RPG
I've always had an interest in RPGs, and they are what drew me to Computer Science to begin with!
I plan to make a simple RPG project using Python OOP principles and socket programming. 

For now this is a solo project and the main objective is to use it to sharpen my own talents. Anyone that would like to use this code is free to do so!
